# adidas coding challenges

The goal is to have public coding challenges so you, developer, can solve them... and start the hiring process if you want to move with us.

This repository contains several coding challenges in different folders, and inside them, the same challenge with the necessary code to be executed in different languages. We usually work with Java, Kotlin, Go, Swift, JavaScript and TypeScript in most of the projects.

## Way of working

There are several types of challenges, and the documentation of each of them explains the expectations and instructions.

### Algorithms

The goal of this type of challenge is to implement a single function, which is the entry point of the challenge.

Steps to work with it:

1. Fork the repository.
1. Go to the challenge folder and read the challenge wording.
1. Go to the language folder which contains the code base and the tests and read the installation and running/testing instructions.
1. Run the tests (failing).
1. Implement the function and run the tests until they go green.
1. Commit your changes.

### Applications:

The application challenges consist in the implementation of an application, or at least part of it. For instance a frontend with mocked data, a backend with testing scripts, or a full application.

The process of the application challenges is similar, however, not all of them will have a code base in which starts working on, so, the challenge documentation will explain all the steps to work with.

Steps to work with it:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Go to the challenge folder and read the challenge wording, and follow the instructions.

If you have to deploy something, you can use free platforms such as [Heroku][heroku], [GitHub pages][github-pages], [netlify][netlify], [CodeSandbox][codesandbox], etc.

## Send us your work!

If you solve any of them and you want to work with us, just send us the link of your forked repository and a brief description of your work at _software.engineering@adidas.com_.

There are no limitations about the implementation, the developer can follow the programming paradigm, modularization, style, etc. that the developer prefers. However, good coding practices, understandable code and good documentation will be taken into account.

Thank you!
